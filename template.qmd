  Accurate prediction of dynamic states in complex physical systems is critical for intelligent decision-support and control. This paper presents a novel spatio-temporal deep learning framework tailored to expert systems operating in mobility and transportation environments. Using a large-scale, multi-source dataset collected over two years from a 100-kilometer highway segment, the proposed model integrates static road geometry features—specifically curvature and slope—into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. We introduce GeoLSTM, a geometry-aware neural network model that enhances mid-term traffic forecasting accuracy across multiple metrics, including vehicle speed, total intensity and heavy-weight vehicle intensity, addressing the common omission of static road geometry by embedding curvature and slope. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating static spatial features significantly reduces prediction error (up to 26% for speed and 16% for heavy-vehicle intensity) and improves model stability, outperforming both traditional baselines and transformer-based alternatives. We further quantify computational costs to assess real-time deployment feasibility. These results establish a robust methodology for integrating contextual spatial data into deep learning-based expert systems, with potential generalization across other domains requiring predictive modelling in structured, data-rich environments.

## Introduction {#sec-intro}

*TODO* In recent years, traffic management systems are increasingly depending on precise real-time traffic forecasting (Pan et al., 2024) to improve response effectiveness and resource allocation when exceptional situations like accidents or congestion happen. For these systems to effectively handle regular traffic patterns, predictive accuracy is crucial. Furthermore, the surge of new technologies related to smart cities infrastructure, autonomous vehicles (AVs) or mobility services also benefit from new data sources for accurate traffic state predictions. Nowadays dynamic inputs from high-resolution traffic sensors and GPS data allow for more responsive and adaptable road network control in a variety of situations (Seo et al., 2017). However, most operational forecasting systems still neglect the static physical constraints of the road network, such as curvature and slope, which can systematically influence vehicle behaviour, lane capacity, and congestion onset. This motivates our integration of road geometry into deep learning architectures, aiming to improve both accuracy and stability in real-time traffic prediction.
The data used in this study comes from the AP-7 highway in Catalonia, a high-traffic corridor that serves as a representative example for evaluating the proposed approach. The methodology, combining static geometry with dynamic traffic features, is designed to be applicable to other highway networks with similar data availability, enabling broader deployment and generalization. Covering a 100-kilometer segment, the highway has infrastructure sensors (inductive loop detectors) providing detailed traffic intensity data (including heavy vehicles) and GPS-derived speed statistics at a granularity of 1-minute intervals. This extensive two-year dataset was aggregated to hourly intervals, facilitating precise and operationally meaningful mid-term traffic forecasts. This particular segment was selected due to its high frequency of congestion-related incidents, which significantly impact regional mobility and safety (Guasch, 2024). The scope of this article is interurban roads (highways), with urban environments outside the present scope because they must be treated differently (Zhu et al., 2023).
The core contribution of this research lies in the applied integration of static road geometry features—specifically curvature and slope—into established deep learning architectures for traffic forecasting. Rather than introducing new architecture types, this work focuses on model improvements for real-world deployment in structured highway environments, substantially improving predictive accuracy. “Existing deep learning approaches often lack spatial awareness beyond immediate sensor locations, and even spatial models rarely incorporate static environmental features .This results in forecasts that may perform well under stable conditions but degrade when geometric constraints alter driver behaviour. Our work directly addresses this shortcoming (Wang et al., 2024). Incorporating additional contextual variables, such as vehicle weight classifications and a mobility calendar indicating holidays and special events, further enhances the system's performance. Given the primary objectives of the Catalan Traffic Authority—improving road safety and reducing mortality rates—the accuracy gains offered by this enhanced forecasting approach directly translate into practical operational improvements.
By developing real-time traffic forecasting systems, traffic authorities can proactively implement targeted interventions to mitigate potential hazards or congestion, thus significantly enhancing regional traffic safety and operational efficiency. This practical application underscores the broader relevance of this research in developing intelligent, data-driven decision-support systems capable of improving transportation efficiency, safety, and reliability. By combining detailed road geometry data with dynamic traffic compositions, the proposed model accurately captures complex traffic patterns across diverse road conditions, setting a new benchmark for predictive accuracy and operational utility in intelligent transportation systems (Seo et al., 2017).

The main contributions of this work are as follows:
•	We propose GeoLSTM, a geometry-aware LSTM model that integrates static road features (curvature, slope) alongside dynamic traffic variables for spatio-temporal mid-term highway traffic forecasting.
•	Demonstration that the proposed GeoLSTM improves traffic predictions accuracy by up to 26% compared to geometry-agnostic models.
•	Performance comparison showing that GeoLSTM outperforms advanced baselines, including Transformer-based architectures for highway traffic hourly data providing mid-term predictions.
•	Validation of the model on a large-scale, real-world dataset collected over two years on a 100-km highway, demonstrating significant error reductions across multiple traffic indicators.
•	Evidence of enhanced spatial robustness across diverse highway segments.
•	Reproducible methodology using open-access road geometry data, enabling adaptation to other highway networks with similar data availability.
The remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a comprehensive review of prior work in traffic forecasting, spanning from traditional statistical models to advanced deep learning architectures. Section 3 details the dataset and formalizes the forecasting problem, including the spatial and temporal structure of the traffic data and the inclusion of static geometric features. Section 4 describes the methodological framework, outlining the neural architectures considered, the integration of road geometry, and the training and optimization protocols. Section 5 presents the experimental results, including comparative performance analyses, feature importance assessments, and computational efficiency evaluations. Finally, Section 6 discusses the broader implications of the findings, acknowledges limitations, and proposes directions for future research.
